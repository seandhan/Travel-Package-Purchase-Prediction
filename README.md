## 🤓 Description <a name = "description"></a>

"Visit with us" travel company wants to retain its customers for a longer time period by launching a long-term travel package.

The company had launched a holiday package last year and 18% of the customers purchased that package however, the marketing cost was quite high because customers were contacted at random without looking at the available information.

Now again the company is planning to launch a new product i.e., a long-term travel package, but this time company wants to utilize previously available data to reduce the marketing cost.


`Objectives`:
1. Analyze existing customer data to provide data-driven recommendations for the marketing team's strategies.
2. Develop a predictive model to identify potential long-term travel package customers and enhance conversion rates through targeted marketing efforts

## ✨ Recommendations <a name = "recommendations"></a>

Based on the analysis the following recommendations can be made:

1. Ideal customers to target would be Executives, having a passport, who are either single or divorced and enquired on travel plans by themselves.
2. Having a Passport is the greatest indication that a person will be interested in purchasing a travel product.
3. Customers who are not partnered are also those who will have a higher proplensity to travel.
4. Free Lancers who travel for their jobs may not be inclined to purchase a travel plan as they may want to settle and relax on their downtime.
